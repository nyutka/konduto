We are happy to launch today our new fraud solution for app-based businesses. We have seen the rise of m-commerce in the past years, going from a minor "nice-to-have" to a big "must-have" for merchants who want to capture and convert more sales. Mobile payments are a hot topic today and mobile fraud is right next to it. Up until now merchants who processed orders and payments directly from their app didn't leverage our browsing navigation algorigthm, but no more!

With our new SDK you will be able to feed every step of the in-app purchase to our Machine Learning algorithm, as well as the traditional order data you send today. We are able to capture geolocation and device information to get a super accurate idea of that customer's behavior and understand if it matches fraudulent patterns.

The SDK is available for iOS version 6 and up and Android 1 and up.
